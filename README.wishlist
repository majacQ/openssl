A "wish list" of changes we'd like to make to the FIPS module if we could.
Note the CMVP requires retesting of all previously tested platforms
("Operational Environments") to implement any changes considered "cryptographically
significant". Since the OpenSSL FIPS module v2.0 has some 250 such formally
tested platforms (and counting), retesting just isn't logistically or economically
feasible.
